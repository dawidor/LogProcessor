1. After grdle build please use the following zip:
    a) LogMonitoringService\build\distributions\LogMonitoringService-boot-1.0.zip
    b) unzip
    c) bin\LogMonitoringService.bat "some.json"
    
2. If you open in ide and it is compiling and complain about unknown variable'log' and setters and getters it means your IDE is missing lombok plugin

E.g. for intellij you need to download plugin from: 
Https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin

And copy 2x libs to you idea.
